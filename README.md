## Hi there! 👋

## About Me

I am a recent graduate with degrees in Big Data Analytics and Physics from Wrocław University of Technology. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in data science, mathematical modeling, and advanced analytics. Big fan of E-Sport, especially League of Legends.

## What I'm Doing

Currently, I am:

- **Creating and Analyzing Datasets:** Working on datasets related to major League of Legends tournaments, such as the League of Legends European Championship (**LEC**), Korean League of Legends Championship (**LCK**), and the League of Legends Pro League (**LPL**) games to gain insights into game dynamics and player performance. You you are interested you can find my datasets on Kaggle [www.kaggle.com/smvjkk].
  - **LEC Spring Season/Playoffs 2024 🌸** ✔️
  - **LEC Summer Season/Playoffs 2024 ☀️** ✔️
  - **LEC Season Finals 2024 👑** ✔️
 
  - **LCK Summer Season/Playoffs 2024 ☀️** ✔️
  - **LCK Regional Finals 👑** ✔️
  - 
  - **LPL Summer Season/Playoffs 2024☀️** ✔️
  - **LPL Regional Finals 👑** ✔️
 
  - **Worlds 2024**
    
- **Developing a Python Library:** Working on a Python library as part of my master’s thesis. This library focuses on:
  - **Autoencoder-Based Neural Network:** Successfully designed and implemented using PyTorch to efficiently reconstruct high-dimensional input vectors. ✔️
  - **Future Enhancements:** Aiming to address the need for improved handling of complex spectral functions and provide a comprehensive tool for various inverse problems.

## Skills
